# 🛡️ Military Personnel Management System (MPMS) (V1)
**An Enterprise-grade solution for automated administration and departmental synchronization.**

## 📖 Project Overview
Developed during active duty within the Security Forces, this system was engineered to modernize military administration by replacing legacy manual processes with a high-performance digital infrastructure. The MPMS ensures that mission-critical data moves faster than the paperwork it replaces by focusing on automation, data integrity, and cross-departmental transparency.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system is built on a **Centralized Data Model** designed to eliminate "Data Silos" and establish a Single Source of Truth (SSOT).
